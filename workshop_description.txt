The primary goal of this mod is to provide more realism to Stellaris without compromising core game mechanics. It focuses on adjusting star systems, their components, and user interface elements related to them. Everything detailed below is mostly [b][i]planned[/i][/b] as the mod is in beta to give players time to test the features, give feedback, and perhaps make adjustments to other mods. Please reference the "Change Notes" tab to learn which features are currently implemented. Screenshots will be updated as more features get added.
