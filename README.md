# Image Enhancement

## Gigapixel AI v6.2.2 Settings

1. Converted from the base DDS into an uncompressed TGA file using GIMP. TGA is the image format closest to DDS, and results in the most feature preservation. Since Gigapixel doesn't accept DDS files this is the better alternative.
2. When saving the image, Gigapixel will write it as a 16-bit TIFF file. Trying to open this directly in GIMP launches an error prompt about there being an extra channel. RawTherapee was used to eliminate this problem and save it as a 16-bit TIF file.
3. The resulting TIF image was then saved as an uncompressed DDS file from GIMP.
